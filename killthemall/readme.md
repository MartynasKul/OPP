Game is so simple, but it can be used as a starting point to develop something more complex. Right now, players only can do following things.
- Move with W,A,S,D
- Shoot Circles to heal
- Shoot other players to win.

## Architecture

This game follows Authoritative server approach. Which means, clients sends their every move to the server, servers does the validity check and then updates their status.
